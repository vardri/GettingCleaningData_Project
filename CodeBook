CODE_BOOK
=========

Script purposes:
1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each 
activity and each subject.

Data:
Data sets represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is 
available at the site where the data was obtained: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 
and the data can be uploaded here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 


Files:
Data are contained into the UCI HAR Dataset, which contain txt files and two folders: test and train. The following text files
are necessary for the project:
- features.txt
- activity_labels.txt
- subject_train.txt
- x_train.txt
- y_train.txt
- subject_test.txt
- x_test.txt
- y_test.txt

The working directory is set up at the beginning of the script, don't forget to change it according to yours when using this script.

So first step is to read the files and merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. In the script, it corresponds
to
##1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  ##A.Read in the data from files into the main, train and test folder
  ##B.Assign names to each column of the dataset
  ##C.Merge A) the three subsets: yTrain, subjectTrain, and xTrain and B) the three test subsets: xTest, yTest and 
  subjectTest data
  ##D.Combine the data set created en C and D to get the final data set
  ##E.Create a vector for the column names from the finalData, which will be used in step 2 for the mean and standard 
  deviation

Then, the requiered info is extracted:
##2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.  
  ##A.Create a logicalVector that contains TRUE values for requieres info: ID, mean() & stddev() columns and FALSE 
  for rest
  ##B.Subset finalData table created in 1D using the logicalVector

Columns need to be rename with the activity type, and it is achieved byt step 3 and 4:
##3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
  ##A.Merge the finalData updated in 2B with the acitivityType table to include the activity names
  ##B.Updating the colNames vector to include the new info about activity
##4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  ##A.Clean up the variable names
  
Finally, the TidyData Set is created and the results are written into the work repo:
##5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each 
variable for each activity and each subject.
  ##A.Create tidy data set with the average of each variable
  ##B.Merging the tidy data set with activity type to data for each activity/subject
  ##C.Write the tidy data set into folder
