GettingCleaningData_Project
===========================
Repo for the submission of the course project for Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course by Val Ouellet

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 


Repo contents
===========================
We are required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. The repo should also include a README.md with the scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
